## 👋 Introduction

The Melbourne bitcoin community came out from the epic lockdown experience a little battered, but slowly remade itself during 2022. During this time, the [telegram channel](https://t.me/btcmelbourne) grew as plebs started to meetup in random spots across the city (parks, markets etc).

For some in the Melbourne community, while meeting up in random spots was cool, there was a yearning for more. A yearning for a place that they could call their own. A place where everybody could gather. 

And from here, the project began. Following the Bitcoin Alive conference in Sydney Aoril 2023, a few plebs started to research and conduct feasibility studies on business models for a type of bitcoin place.

🎙️ We are documenting our story through a [podcast](https://listen.unspent.space)
