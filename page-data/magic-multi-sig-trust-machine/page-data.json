We each put the same amount of bitcoin in a 2-of-3 and agreed that we would each stack equally as much as we could, with a loose goal of pooling some funds for testing and maybe to go towards supporting a new bitcoin project. At first the other two guys were a bit skeptical. I said the MultiSig had special powers. They indulged the idea, after all it is magical internet money we are playing with, and we each put a very small amount of bitcoin in.. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The next week we were talking about starting a business and adding 10 times as much bitcoin to the MultiSig! A month later we had formal business meetings, spreadsheets, slides, a web site and a public community brewing. This MultiSig linked us together in a subtle subconscious way. We would lose honour if we were to neglect or misuse it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We built trust in each other as the MultiSig continued through adversity. Little details of life and all types of issue that build up when working together are put into perspective by the MultiSig. Commitment is anchored to something that is fixed and well defined. We can see that we can trust each other not to rug pull on finances,  but also not to back out on other less tangible but equally valuable commitments. The MultiSig helped us to understand the scale of the group's plan and to weigh each individuals perspective to the common goal.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We 10x'd the amount in the MultiSig again. Not quite simultaneously, we had hesitation. One person raised, I matched, but with a low ball fee. We took our time to put together our spare bitcoin, some of us struggling to understand why we are putting so much into something not directly needed. A little bit of peer pressure and now we are all balanced, with a significant pool of capital.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Soon after the business plans are flourishing. We have a brand, a concept and a new way of doing things. Open-source in the structure of bitcoin, but here we have an added layer of human relationships.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We can scale MultiSigs by allowing them to appear wherever people want them. The MultisSigs can connect with people anywhere, giving us a foundation for scaling internationally as well as within unspent.space locations. I expect that we will have many small groups with there own MulltiSigs, much like ours, working together openly and overlapping in each location.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The guys still kind of tease me about my seeming obsession with the Magic MultiSig Trust Machine or whatever else want to call this new thing? Thats fine, It's new and to me that makes it more reminiscent of bitcoin.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"So what is it?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is very easy to think of things in the old way, according to a fiat narrative. It gets into our minds in places we don't even know exist. When we want to build \\\"the ultimate bitcoin club house of sorts\\\" (unspent.space) it is hard to define clearly what it is and form a strategy without fiat leaking in. I think that the first step is building strong community relationships. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"With these shared Multisigs relationships are the foundation of the organisation in a tangible way and it keeps focus on bitcoin so we can do truly productive things. I think this is building the bitcoin way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The first step is only a small one. Let me explain how this can work.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The code of a MultiSig combines multiple humans in control over bitcoin. This is a new form of ownership that has not been well defined in the fiat or legal system and which in a way supersedes it. \\\"Code is law\\\" is now combined with the natural law between people. \"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Why?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The two main functions of these Magic MultiSig Trust Machines are as follows:\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Collaborative Bitcoin Fund\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This function allows people to easily and pool resources for a common purpose. You could call it a trust minimised de-intermediated investment club. For example, podcasters might want to share the costs of a new microphone and special recording equipment. International FOSS collaborators might want to join forces to finance software or projects they deem important. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We have apps on bitcoin allow shared multisig to be performed easily. Imagine a shared online bank account with a chat integrated that sent you a notification when someone wanted your approval. We are way ahead of the fiat world here. It's cheap (almost free), easy and secure.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Communication channels within the accounts are important, it means that no one can claim they missed an important message. Clear information about spending is kept in one place and all participants are included in each decision to the degree defined by the rules of the multisig.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Investments will be measured against the value of bitcoin and will only proceed after a threshold of signers agree, in our case 2 of 3. I expect this grounding in bitcoin makes investments wiser. Our social contract is that members of the MultiSig can leave with their initial contributions or more, but only if the other members agree that this is fair.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"MultiSig Bond\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A \\\"Bond\\\" is interesting as insurance between the members, like a house rental bond. If at any point in time one member should not live up to the natural law of the group in any way, the other two parties have the ability to enforce whatever they feel is financially just.  \"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"What about volatility?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"What if the bitcoin price goes up?\\\" Well that's great, the trust increases, the capacity of the business increases in line with the growth of bitcoin. This brings the organisation into the new bitcoin economy. On the same level as the financially transcendent guy living on bitcoin and selling all the chairs in his house to stack as much as possible. The same economy as bitcoin mining or lightning nodes and open source software. The decentralised future creating value all over the place, maybe not clearly measurable in fiat terms, I would say infinity divided by 21; immense. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"What if the bitcoin price goes down?\\\" Well you have to accept the ups along with the downs, but regardless of the shared pain, the MultiSig human bond lives on. If the business doesn't grow astronomically during the bear market then the MultiSig is a great way to hodl bitcoin together as a group.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The more volatility the MultiSig endures, the stronger it becomes. If it doesn't handle the volatility, from free market perspective this is probably for a good reason.   \"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"How it Grows\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"unspent.space is made up of a few things as we see it. After-hours members and events, All-hours members and hot desks, podcasting, bitcoin business, international collaboration and FOSS development. Ideally we would see MultiSigs of different types being started for each purpose. Any cohesive niche will do. These could be big or small with varying people participating from anywhere. So give it a go and start with an amount you are comfortable with. The main thing is finding the right people. People who are curious.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It would be great if there would be a MultiSig, simply set idea of putting the funds towards your goals.
