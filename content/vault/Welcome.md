# Welcome!


Welcome to the unspent.space site. Whether you're trying to start your own space or joining others, this community will help you join the dots.

## What is unspent.space?
unspent.space started out as a cool name to describe the project for creating a permanent space for bitcoiners in Melbourne. As we started documenting our approach and research in github, we soon realised that unspent.space could be so much more than just Melbourne. Maybe unspent.space could be like an open-source franchise? Or maybe an open community with people that support each other creating permanent spaces. 

To find out more the movement, visit the [about](/about) page.

## How can you get involved?
There are a number of ways you can get involved, including:
- Join in the conversation on the discord server.
- Start your own unspent.space somewhere in the world. We can help you with your business case and getting started.
- Make pull requests on github if you find things to improve.
