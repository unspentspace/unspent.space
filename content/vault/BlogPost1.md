# MultiSig Magic Trust Machine


One day at BItcoin Alive, three new friends started a MultiSig. They each put the same amount of bitcoin in set it at 2 of3 for signing and agreed that they would each stack equally in the thing as much as they could, with a loose goal of pooling some funds for fun or maybe to go towards supporting a bitcoin space. Two of the guys were curious but maybe a bit skeptical when later I said that I think the multisig like this has special powers but they indulged me, after all it is Magical Internet money.

The next week we were talking about starting a business. Then adding 10x the bitcoin. A month later we had formal business meetings, spreadsheets, slides a web site and public communities brewing. The MultiSig linked us together in a way that we would have to loose honour to break. We built trust in each other as the little details of life and constructive critique built up and we could see that we could trust each other not to rug pool, or back out on other less tangible but equally valuable commitments. The multisig helped us to know the true scale of the plan, the significance for each party at the time. 

We 10x the MultiSig again, we had stragglers, high fee markets and peer pressure. Now we are all balanced, with a significant pool of capital. The business is growing.

We have a brand, a concept and a new way of doing things. Open source in the structure of bitcoin, but in another layer with human relationships, through the same code but in a different way, with a similar viral effect. Chris and Daz still kind of tease me about my seeming obsession with the MultiSig Trust Machine or whatever we want to call this new thing? To me though thats fine, It's new and to me that makes it more reminiscent of bitcoin.

## So what is it?

It is very easy to think of things in the old way, according to fiat narrative. It gets into us in places we don't even know. When wanting to build the ultimate bitcoin club house of sorts, real estate. Even the name is almost double speak. I think that these MultiSigs are the secrete sauce of unpent.space, I have many reasons, but we will save them for later. The first step here, I invite you to take is only a small one. Let me explain how this can work.

The code of a Multisig combines multiple humans into control over bitcoin. This is a new form of ownership that has not been defined in the Fiat/legal system and which in a way superseeds it. Code is law, is now combined with the natural law between people. 

## Why?

These Multisig things need a name, we hav't settled on one yet, but the main functions I can see are.

### Collaborative Bitcoin Fund
This allows people to easily and pool resources for a common purpose. Podcasters might want to have share the costs of resources which they will use, eg a new microphone and special recording equipment. The free digital apps on bitcoin allow this to be done cheaply and securely and integrate a communication channel with the account, providing a clear information for all participants in decision making and giving them control over spending to the degree that they want it. 

Investments will be measured against the value of bitcoin and will only occur at the will of the signer threshold, in our case 2 of 3. I expect this makes investments wiser. Loyalty to is impacted by the bitcoin at stake. Signers can leave with their initial contributions only at the will of the signer threshold.  

### MultiSig Bond
"Bond" is interesting as the insurance between the parties. If at any point in time one member should not live up to the natural law of the group in any way, the other two parties have the ability to enforce whatever the feel is financially just, in bitcoin terms. In this way it is like a bond you pay when you rent a house.

## What about volatility?
What if the bitcoin price goes up? We thats great, the trust increases, the capacity of the business increases in line with the growth of bitcoin. This brings the organisation into the new bitcoin economy. On the same level as the financially transcendent guy living on bitcoin and selling all his chairs. The same economy bitcoin mining as lightning nodes and open source software. The decentralised future creating value all over the place, maybe not measurable in fiat, but i would say infinity divided by 21; immense.

What if the bitcoin price goes down? Well you have to take the ups along with the dawns, but regardless the MultiSig bond lives on. If the business doesn't grow astronomically the MultiSig is a great way to stack bitcoin together. 

The more volatility the MultiSig endures the stronger it becomes. If it doesn't handle it, from a new bitcoin economy perspective it is closing for a good reason. People can close the multiSig and distribute funds equally or fairly between them at any time.

## How it Grows
unspent.space is made up of a few things as we see it. Afterhours members and events, All hours members and hot desks, podcasting, bitcoin business and FOSS development. Ideally we would see multisigs of different types started for each area. These might be bigger or smaller and some people in these may participate in multiple collaborative multisigs. At the moment we are using Nunchuck to do it. So give it a go and just start with an amount you are comfortable with. You don't need to go big straight away, the main thing is finding the right people. 

It would be great if each niche would have a MultiSig, simply set up with the goal of putting the fund towards creating your vision of unspent.space in your home town. 
### Spec
- Nunchuk.io app runs on most operating systems (investigating alternatives let us know)
- Each MultiSig group should feel aligned to a common goal.
- Groups should not have more than 8 people in them. (studies say that more than that is to hard to organise)
- The signer threshold depends on the amount of trust in your group, I recommend starting a simple 2 of 3. BUt new Multisigs with lower thresholds can be considered in the future
- If you want to do more than three people remember that you will have more UTXO's and that should to many members disappear or want to exit, you will have to close it and start again.
- Tapsigners are great as you can easily back them up and keep your keys cold whilst still being able to quickly use them with your phone quickly

## The Kicker
I believe collaborative MultiSigs are a new magic human layer on top of our magical bitcoin money. It combines psychology, modern organisation theory and sound money to create something we haven't seen before, and that will take more than one post to explain.I think MultiSig Magic Trust Machines will be a core part of the new economy (the bitcoin economy). 

For me it is the unspent bitcoin which can make unspent.space's strong all around the world... start another story like this.
