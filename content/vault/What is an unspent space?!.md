# What is an unspent space?!

![](./media/empty-room6.jpg)

You probably found this website from a note on nostr or a tweet on twitter, or maybe you heard it on a podcast. And you might be curious, but also wondering, what is an unspent space?

## Bitcoiner spaces
Essentially an unspent space is waiting to be occupied by bitcoiners. The name comes from the UTXO concept; unspent transaction output. It's the output from a previous transaction, and importantly it can be the input for a future transaction.

Similarly, physical spaces can be unspent, meaning that they were previously spent and are now sitting waiting to be spent again. If we want to get pedantic, unlike UTXOs, physical spaces are less fungible and cannot generally be broken up into smaller unspent spaces. However that could be possible ðŸ¤¯. 

Anyway, I came up with the idea while mucking around with domain names. 

## What kind of bitcoin spaces?

Well, really, that's up to you? It depends on who you are, who your buddies are, where you live, what activities you like. It might be a co-working space, it might be a cafe, it might be an event space or all of the above. The main feature is that it serves to build the bitcoiner community in your local neighbourhood.

In general, at unspent.space we believe that it is a space that centres around bitcoin and free and open source software, specifically related to freedom technologies. 

So the types of words and phrases that would fit in at a bitcoin space include:

#### bitcoin | lightning network | submarine swaps | privacy | utxo | coinbase | mining | asic | gpu | node | samurai | whirlpool | hardware wallet | liquidity | splicing | chaumian ecash | fedi | cashu | nostr | bitcoin core | mempool | satoshi | sats/byte | command line | austrian economics | libertarian | mises | self-soverign | verify, don't trust | game theory | satoshi nakamoto | open source | peer-to-peer | sound money | blockchain | timechain | decentralisation

Can you think of any others?
