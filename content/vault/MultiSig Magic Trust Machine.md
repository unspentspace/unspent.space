# MultiSig Magic Trust Machine


## My Story

At Bitcoin Alive in Sydney 2023, three new friends embarked on a bitcoin MultiSig together. They each deposited the same amount of bitcoin in a 2-of-3 and agreed that they would each stack equally into this wallet as much as they could, with a loose goal of pooling some funds for testing and fun, maybe to go towards supporting a new bitcoin space. At first, two of the guys were perhaps a bit skeptical, but also curious once I mentioned that I think a MultiSig like this has special powers. They indulged it, as after all, this is magical internet money we are working with. We each deposited a very small amount of bitcoin in..

The next week we were talking about starting a business and adding 10 times as much bitcoin to the MultiSig! A month later we had formal business meetings, spreadsheets, slides, a web site, and a public community brewing. This MultiSig linked us together in a sublte subconscious way. We would lose honour and face if we were to neglect or misuse it. 

We built trust in each other as this MultiSig continued through adversity. With sparse details of human life, constructive usage critique, and people operating at different speeds, put our arrangement into perspective. Commitment is anchored to something that is fixed and well defined. We could see that we could trust each other, with a shared monetary responsibility, The MultiSig helped us understand the true scale of the group's plan, the significance for each individual and the weight behind each of our personsal goals. 

We 10xed the amount in the MultiSig, again. Not quite simultaneously, we had hesitation. One person raised, I matched but with a low ball fee. We took our own time to put together our spare bitcoin, some of us struggling to understand why on earth we were chucking so much money into such a newfound relationship. After a little bit of peer pressure, we were all balanced, with a significant pool of capital. 

Soon after, the business plans were flourishing. We have a brand, a concept, and a new way of doing things. Open-source in the structure of bitcoin, but here we had added a layer of human relationship. 

We can scale MultiSigs by allowing them to appear wherever people deem them appropriate. MultisSigs can connect people anywhere, giving us a foundation for scaling internationally as well as within unspent.space locations. I expect that we will have many small groups with their own multisigs, much like ours, working together openly alongside futuristic financial agreements. 

The guys still kind of tease me about my seeming obsession with the MultiSig Trust Machine or whatever else we want to call this new thing? That's fine, It's new and to me that makes it more reminiscent of bitcoin.

## So what is it?

It is very easy to think of things in the old way, and according to the fiat narrative. The alternative gets into us to places we don't even know exist. When we want to build the ultimate bitcoin club house thingy of sorts, I think that building strong community relationships is the first step. 

With that, these MultiSigs can work their magic and great things can be built. I think this is building the bitcoin way. The first step is only a small one. Let me explain how this can work.

The code of a MultiSig combines multiple humans in control over bitcoin. A new form of ownership that has not been defined in the fiat/legal system and and is rather governed by proof of work and mathematics. "Code is law" is now combined with the natural law between people. 

## Why?

These MultiSig relationships need a name, we haven't settled on one yet, but the main functions I can see are as follows:

### Collaborative Bitcoin Fund

A collaborative bitcoin fund allows people to easily and pool resources for a common purpose. You could call it a trust minimised de-intermediated investment club. For example, podcasters might want to share the costs of a new microphone and special recording equipment. International FOSS collaborators might want to join forces to finance software or projects they deem important.

We have apps on bitcoin that allow multisig to be performed easily. Imagine if shared an online bank account, integrated alongside a chat which sends your notifications when someone requestss your approval to spend funds. We are way ahead of the fiat world here. It's cheap, easy and secure.

Communication channels within the accounts are important, it means that no one can claim they missed an important message. Clear information about spending is kept in one place and all participants are included in each decision to the degree defined by the rules of the multisig

Investments will be measured against the value of bitcoin and will only proceed after a threshold of signers agree, in our case 2 of 3. I expect this makes investments wiser. Our social contract is that members of the MultisSig can leave with their initial contributions or more, but only if the other members agree that this is fair.  

### MultiSig Bond

A "Bond" is interesting as insurance between members, like a rental bond. If at any point one member should not live up to the natural law of the group in any way, the other two parties have the ability to enforce whatever they feel is financially just. 

## What about volatility?

"What if the bitcoin price goes up?" Well that's great, the trust increases, the capacity of the business increases in line with the growth of bitcoin. This brings the organisation into the new bitcoin economy. On the same level as the financially transcendent guy living on bitcoin and selling all the chairs in his house to stack as much as possible. A decentralised future creating value all over the place, perhabs not clearly measurable in fiat terms, I would say infinity divided by 21; immense.

"What if the bitcoin price goes down?" Well you have to accept the ups along with the downs, but regardless of the shared pain, the MultiSig human bond lives on. If the business doesn't grow astronomically during the bear market then the MultiSig is a great way to hodl bitcoin together as a group.

The more volatility the MultiSig endures, the stronger it becomes. If it doesn't handle the volatility, from the free market perspective this is probably for good reason.

## How our Multisig Grows

unspent.space is made up of a few things as we see it. After-hours members and events, All-hours members and hot desks, podcasting, bitcoin business, international collaboration and FOSS development. Ideally we would see MultiSigs of many sdifferent types being started for each purpose. These multisigs could be big or small, with varying people participating in a range of collaborative MultiSigs. We strongly encourage you to create a multisig with your peers. Start with an amount you are comfortable with. The main thing is finding the right people. People who are curious and willing to explore frontiers of human interaction. 

It would be great if each cohesive niche throughout the world would have their own MultiSig, a simply set up treasury with the goal of directing funds towards a vision. Perhaps an unspent.space in your home town.

## Spec

- Nunchuk.io app runs on most operating systems and provides us our multisig tech.
- Each MultiSig group should be aligned towards a common goal.
- Groups should not have more than 8 people in them. (studies say that more than that is to hard to organise) and probably best to start with 3 or 4 until things get moving.
- The signer threshold depends upon the amount of trust in your group, I recommend starting with a simple 2 of 3.
- Consider fault tolerance, a large group means more chance of people wanting to leave the MultiSig and having to reform it with different members. Higher signer thresholds are slower to approve and are more susceptible to inactive members or lost keys.
- [Tapsigners](https://tapsigner.com/) are great multisig tool as you can easily back them up and keep your keys cold whilst still being able to quickly use them alongside nunchuck on your phone.

## The Kicker

Collaborative MultiSigs are a new magic human layer on top of magical internet money. Multisigs combine psychology, modern organisation theory and sound money to create something we the world has never seen before. MultiSig Magic Trust Machines will be a core part of the future, and the bitcoin economy. 

For me, it is the unspent bitcoin which can make an unspent.space strong.. Now it is up to you to create your own tribe's multisig and continue this story.
