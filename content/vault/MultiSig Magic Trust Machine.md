# MultiSig Magic Trust Machine


## My Story

At Bitcoin Alive, three new friends started a bitcoin MultiSig. They each put the same amount of bitcoin in set it at 2 of 3 for signing and agreed that they would each stack equally in the thing as much as they could, with a loose goal of pooling some funds for testing and fun, maybe to go towards supporting a new bitcoin space. Two of the guys were curious, but maybe a bit skeptical when later I said that I think the MultiSig like this has special powers, but they indulged me after all it is magical internet money. We each put a very small amount of bitcoin in..

The next week we were talking about starting a business and adding 10 times as much bitcoin to the MultiSig. A month later we had formal business meetings, spreadsheets, slides a web site and public communities brewing. The MultiSig linked us together in a subtle I think subconscious way. We would loose a kind of honour should we break it. 

We built trust in each other as the MultiSig held together through adversity. Little details of life, constructive critique, people operating at different speeds, issue that build up are put into perspective. Commitment is anchored to something that is fixed and well defined. We could see that we could trust each other not to rug pool, or back out on other less tangible but equally valuable commitments. The MultiSig helped us to know the true scale of the groups plan, the significance for each individual at the time and put a measured weight behind each persons goals. 

We 10x the MultiSig again, not quite simultaneously, we had hesitation. One person raised, I matched but with a low ball fee and one of us struggled to get the spare bitcoin together and to understand why. A little bit of peer pressure and now we are all balanced, with a significant pool of capital. 

The business is growing. We have a brand, a concept and a new way of doing things. Open-source in the structure of bitcoin, but with an added layer of human relationships. 

We can scale MultiSigs by allowing them to appear wherever people want them. The MultisSigs can connect with people anywhere, giving us a foundation for scaling internationally and also within unspent.space locations. I expect that we will have many small groups like ours working together and overlapping in each location. 

The guys still kind of tease me about my seeming obsession with the MultiSig Trust Machine or whatever we want to call this new thing? Thats fine, It's new and to me that makes it more reminiscent of bitcoin.

## So what is it?

It is very easy to think of things in the old way, according to fiat narrative. It gets into us in places we don't even know. When wanting to build the ultimate bitcoin club house thingy of sorts, real-estate, the word itself which is a sales pitch, often first comes to mind. I think that building a community, a strong group, is the first step. 

With that these MultiSigs can work their magic and great things can be built. I think this is building the bitcoin way, I have many reasons, but I will have to save them for later. The first step is only a small one. Let me explain how this can work.

The code of a MultiSig combines multiple humans in control over bitcoin. This is a new form of ownership that has not been defined in the fiat/legal system and which in a way supersedes it. "Code is law" is now combined with the natural law between people. 

## Why?

These MultiSig things need a name, we haven't settled on one yet, but the main functions I can see are.

### Collaborative Bitcoin Fund

This allows people to easily and pool resources for a common purpose. You could call it a trust minimised de-intermediated investment club. For example, podcasters might want to share the costs of a new microphone and special recording equipment. International FOSS collaborators might want to join forces to help build a version of unspent.space in their town.

We have apps on bitcoin allow this to be done easily. Imagine your a shared online bank account with a chat integrated that sent you a notification when someone wanted your approval. We are way ahead of the fiat world here. it's cheap, easy and secure. 

Communication channels within the accounts are important, it means no one can claim they missed an important message. Clear information about spending is kept in one place and all participants are included in decision by the math to the degree that they want. 

Investments will be measured against the value of bitcoin and will only occur at the signer threshold, in our case 2 of 3. I expect this makes investments wiser. Member of the MultisSig can leave with their initial contributions or more, but only if the other members agree that it is fair.  

### MultiSig Bond

"Bond" is interesting as insurance between the members, like a rental bond. If at any point in time one member should not live up to the natural law of the group in any way, the other two parties have the ability to enforce whatever they feel is financially just. 

## What about volatility?

"What if the bitcoin price goes up?" Well thats great, the trust increases, the capacity of the business increases in line with the growth of bitcoin. This brings the organisation into the new bitcoin economy. On the same level as the financially transcendent guy living on bitcoin and selling all his chairs. The same economy as bitcoin mining or lightning nodes and open source software. The decentralised future creating value all over the place, maybe not measurable in fiat, but I would say infinity divided by 21; immense.

"What if the bitcoin price goes down?" Well you have to take the ups along with the downs, but regardless of the shared pain, the MultiSig human bond lives on. If the business doesn't grow astronomically during the bear market  the MultiSig is a great way to hodl bitcoin together. 

The more volatility the MultiSig endures the stronger it becomes. If it doesn't handle it, from a new bitcoin economy perspective it is for a good reason. People can close the multiSig and distribute funds fairly between them at any time.

## How it Grows

unspent.space is made up of a few things as we see it. After-hours members and events, All-hours members and hot desks, podcasting, bitcoin business, international collaboration and FOSS development. Ideally we would see MultiSigs of different types started for each area. These might be bigger or smaller and some people in these may participate in multiple collaborative MultiSigs. So give it a go and just start with an amount you are comfortable with. You don't need to go big straight away, the main thing is finding the right people. 

It would be great if each cohesive niche would have a MultiSig, simply set up with the goal of putting the fund towards creating your vision of unspent.space in your home town.

## Spec

- Nunchuk.io app runs on most operating systems (investigating alternatives let us know)
- Each MultiSig group should feel aligned to a common goal.
- Groups should not have more than 8 people in them. (studies say that more than that is to hard to organise) and probably best to start with 3 or 4
- The signer threshold depends on the amount of trust in your group, I recommend starting a simple 2 of 3, new MultiSigs with lower thresholds can be considered in the future with experience
- Consider fault tolerance, more people means more chance of closing the MultiSig and having to reform it with different members. High signer thresholds are slower to approve and are more susceptible to someone loosing their keys
- If you want to do more than three people remember that you will have more UTXO's and that should to many members disappear or want to exit, you will have to close it and start again.
- Tapsigners are great as you can easily back them up and keep your keys cold whilst still being able to quickly use them with your phone quickly

## The Kicker

I believe collaborative MultiSigs are a new magic human layer on top of our magical bitcoin money. It combines psychology, modern organisation theory and sound money to create something we haven't seen before. I think MultiSig Magic Trust Machines will be a core part of the new economy, the bitcoin economy. 

For me it is the unspent bitcoin which can make unspent.space's strong all around the world... You can start another story like this.
